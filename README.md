# 🏫 Campus Issue Portal

A centralized, AI-assisted web platform that enables students to report campus issues and allows administrators to track, manage, and resolve them efficiently with transparency and accountability.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

In many institutions, campus-related issues such as infrastructure faults, hygiene problems, or classroom maintenance are reported informally through word-of-mouth or scattered channels.  
This leads to:
- Delayed resolutions
- Lack of accountability
- No proper tracking or feedback
- Repeated reporting of the same issues

---
